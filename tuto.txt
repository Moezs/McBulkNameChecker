Hello guys so today i was bored so i thought why not make a script to make the method in last video easier 
so here it is..
its 2 python scripts to make it easy and snipe / find og minecraft names 
first you need to download python 
after that you need to go to your python folder /scripts 
copy this path 
C:\Python27\Scripts
than open cmd and follow me 
type cd C:\Python27\Scripts
than type pip install requests 
i already have it downloaded 
now u put your list of names in names.txt
than open geturls.py
it will automatically put the url to your names like this and save it in urls.txt
now open code.py and wait till finish and check what names are available to get
as you can see it checks if the name is taken or available :D
lets try this
https://api.mojang.com/users/profiles/minecraft/aperiodically
available
this is the ign ( name ) aperiodically
easy method here we see in namemc 
https://api.mojang.com/users/profiles/minecraft/aperiodic
available
lets see again 
and lets see what happens if we try a taken name :D
